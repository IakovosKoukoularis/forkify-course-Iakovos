## 📖 About
Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with a custom API to fetch and display food recipes. It allows users to search for recipes, adjust servings, and bookmark their favorites.

This project was built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure code maintainability and structure, as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced JavaScript course.
